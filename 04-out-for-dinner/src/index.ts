/*
 * Out for Dinner 
 * 
 * REQUIREMENTS
 * 1. Your code should have the variables - `bill`, `tip`, and `total`
 * 2. Your variables - `bill`, `tip`, and `total` should be declared using the `var` keyword
 * 3. Your variable `bill` should be a number, having a value equal to the result of `10.25 + 3.99 + 7.15`
 * 4. Your variable `tip` should be a number, having a value equal to 15% of the `bill`
 * 5. Your variabe `total` should be a number, having a value equal to the `bill` and `tip` added together
 * 6. Your code should print the total to the console. It should equal to 24.60
 * 
 * PRO TIP (tip, as in hint, not monetary tip ;) ):
 * To round total up by two decimal points use the toFixed() method.
 * To use toFixed() pass it the number of decimal points you want to use.
 * For example, if total equals 3.9860, then total.toFixed(2) would return 3.99.
